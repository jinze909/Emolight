  <h1>Company Introduction</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Emolight, a groundbreaking initiative from the innovative team specializing in advanced emotional intelligence technology. Our mission is to bridge the gap between human emotions and environmental interaction through cutting-edge AI solutions.</p>

  <h2>Introduction of Team Members</h2>
  <p>Our team comprises myself (John), a skilled technician primarily responsible for developing, AI training models and programming in Python, as well as Sheena, an accomplished author who specializes in crafting compelling copy and narrative content. Our diverse knowledge converges to create innovative solutions where advanced technology meets human-centric design.</p>

  <h2>Product Introduction</h2>
  <p>The product is a device that can recognize and alleviate different emotions of a person based on their face expression and color light. The device consists of a camera that captures the face of the person, an artificial intelligence model that analyzes the expression and detects the emotion, and a light-emitting diode (LED) that emits different colors of light according to the emotion. The device can be used in driving, to help the person cope with their emotions and improve their well-being.</p>

  <h2>Product Advantages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The product has several advantages over existing solutions, such as:</li>
    <p>It can detect emotions that are often hidden or suppressed by the person, which can provide more accurate and reliable feedback.</p>
    <p>It can provide immediate and personalized intervention to alleviate the negative emotions and enhance the positive ones, which can improve the mood and performance of the person.</p>
    <p>It can use natural and non-invasive methods, such as color light, to influence the emotions.</p>
  </ul>

  <h2>Current Development</h2>
  <p>Currently in the prototype stage, the product's basic functions and features have been implemented and tested. The model identifies five basic emotions and LED strips can emit different colors of light based on the emotions detected by the model, using the following mapping:</p>
  
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Emotion</th>
      <th>LED Color</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sad</td>
      <td>Red</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pleasant</td>
      <td>Blue</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fear</td>
      <td>Green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Surprise</td>
      <td>Lake blue</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Angry</td>
      <td>Yellow</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Future Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>The future development trend of the product is to improve the performance, availability and scalability of the device, and explore new applications and markets. By using more advanced technologies, AI models are enhanced to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. Optimize your hardware by using more efficient and compact devices. Expand functions and features by adding more options and Settings (such as voice control, music playback) to enrich the user experience and provide more feedback and insights. Explore new scenarios and domains by adapting devices to different environments and populations, such as classrooms, hospitals, etc.</p>
